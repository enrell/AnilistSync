<h3 align="center">Big thanks to Crobibero for writing the <a href="https://github.com/crobibero/jellyfin-plugin-simkl">Simkl Plugin</a></h3>

A Jellyfin plugin that scrobbles your anime watches to Anilist for easy automatic list updates.

## Features
- Multi-user support
- Scrobbling of anime shows/movies to Anilist
- Rewatch support


## Requirements
- [Anilist Plugin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-anilist): This plugin relies entirely on the Anilist plugin obtaining the correct ID (**Make sure the metadata of the show contains the correct ID from Anilist!**)! 
- If its wrong or not present, scrobbling with fail

## Install
### Repository
1. Add the repository URL to Jellyfin: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enrell/AnilistSync/master/manifest.json
2. Install AnilistSync from the plugin catalog
3. Install Anilist plugin and activate the metadata provider in the libraries (and ensure it is below your actual metadata provider/low in hierarchy or your metadata will get replaced)
4. Refresh metadata with Search for missing metadata to add in anilist ID or manually add it in using the metadata manager (because if this ID is missing this scrobbler will not work!
